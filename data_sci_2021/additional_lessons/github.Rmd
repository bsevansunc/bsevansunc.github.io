<h3>Version control: Getting started with GitHub</h3>

<p>In this lesson, we will explore how to get started GitHub on your computer. This is meant to be almost entirely applied. Please see the <a href = "https://smbc-nzp.github.io/data_science_workshop/additional_resources.html" target = "_blank"> additional resources<a> page for more in-depth content on version control and GitHub.</p>

<h4>Why do I need version control?</h4>
<p>Version control is an indispensable tool for working with data. When you collaborate with others, it allows for a (somewhat) seamless workflow for sharing code and data. For solo projects, it allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have the same version of your project across all computers you work on</li>
<li>Have backups to your projects all in one place</li>
<li>View (and transport yourself to various points in) the history of your files</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the early benefits of using version control. There are a lot more that are worth exploring (e.g., forking) once you get a little experience under your belt!
